https module in Nodejs
----------------------

this modules allows us to create secure http server and client using SSL/TLS encryption.

🔐 Why https is important:
-data between client and server is encrypted.
-Used in production (never use plain http for real users)
-Required for secure login, payments, APIs, etc.
-Browsers block certain features (e.g., geolocation) on non-HTTPS sites

=======================================

🛠 Create a Secure Server
You need:
-A private key
-A certificate (can be self-signed or from a Certificate Authority).

Open terminal in your project folder.

Run this command:
 
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365
This will generate:

key.pem → Private key

cert.pem → Self-signed certificate

Now use it in your Node.js HTTPS server:
import https from 'https';

const options = {
key: fs.readFileSync('key.pem'), 
cert:fs.readFileSync('cert.pem);
};

https.createServer(options,(req,res)=>{
  res.writeHead(200);
  res.end("hellow secure world);
}).listen(3000,()=>{
  console.log("server running on https://localhost:3000);
});


Note: Modern HTTPS uses TLS (Transport Layer Security), which is the successor to SSL (Secure Sockets Layer). The terms are often used interchangeably, but SSL is now considered deprecated.


🔐 1. What is a Private Key?
🧠 Concept:
A Private Key is a secret file used to encrypt and decrypt data.

It should be kept secure — never shared with anyone.

It is generated as part of a key pair (public key + private key).

📦 In HTTPS:
Your server uses the private key to prove its identity and to decrypt messages from clients.

📜 2. What is a Certificate?
🧠 Concept:
A Certificate contains the public key, and proves the identity of the server to the client (browser).

It is signed by a trusted authority (like DigiCert, Let's Encrypt) or self-signed.

📦 In HTTPS:
Your server gives the certificate to the client.
Client checks: "Is this certificate valid? Is this server trustworthy?"
Certificate contains details like:
Domain name (e.g., example.com)
Organization info
Public key
Expiry date
