What does routing mean?
Routing mean deciding what to do when a request comes to a certain path. 
how an application responds to client requests for a specific endpoint (URL) and HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.).

route defination take following strucutre.

app.method(path, Handler)
Where:

app is an instance of express.
METHOD is an HTTP request method, in lowercase.
PATH is a path on the server.
HANDLER is the function executed when the route is matched.

example:

Respond to a PUT request to the /user route:

app.put('/user', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Got a PUT request at /user')
})
