-Middleware is function inspect, log, modify, or validate the request.
-It runs between the request (req) and the response (res) during the lifecycle of an HTTP request.
-Call next() to pass control to the next middleware or route.

Middleware functions have access to:
(req, res, next)

🤔 Why Is Middleware Needed?
Middleware allows you to:

-Centralize common logic
-Validate data
-Authenticate users
-Log requests
-Handle errors
-Parse incoming data

🔧 How Middleware Works (Flow Diagram):
Client Request → [Middleware 1] → [Middleware 2] → [Route Handler] → Response


Note: middleware can end request-response cycle. If the current middleware function does not end the request-response cycle, it must call next() to pass control to the next middleware function. Otherwise, the request will be left hanging.

app.get('/',function(req,res,next){
  next();
});

function(req,res,next) - this is middleware function.

Starting with Express 5, middleware functions that return a Promise will call next(value) when they reject or throw an error. next will be called with either the rejected value or the thrown Error.

But starting with Express 5, middleware can also return a Promise — and errors are handled automatically.

In Express 5, if a middleware function is async or returns a Promise, and that Promise is rejected (e.g., error thrown), Express automatically calls:

You don’t need to use try...catch manually.

Before (Express 4) Needed try...catch for every async middleware	but now Automatically handles throw or Promise.reject(). Manual error forwarding	Auto next(error).

🧪 Example Comparison:
❌ Old Way (Express 4):

app.use(async (req, res, next) => {
  try {
    await someAsyncFunc();
    next();
  } catch (err) {
    next(err);
  }
});

✅ New Way (Express 5):
app.use(async (req, res, next) => {
  await someAsyncFunc(); // if error occurs, Express handles it
});
