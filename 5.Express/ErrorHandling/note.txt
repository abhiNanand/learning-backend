Error Handling refers to how Express catches and processes errors that occur both synchronously and asynchronously. Express comes with a default error handler so you donâ€™t need to write your own to get started.

If synchronous code throws an error, then Express will catch and process it. For example:

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  throw new Error("BROKEN") // Express will catch this on its own.
})

For errors returned from asynchronous functions invoked by route handlers and middleware, you must pass them to the next() function, where Express will catch and process them. For example:

app.get('/', (req, res, next) => {
  fs.readFile('/file-does-not-exist', (err, data) => {
    if (err) {
      next(err) // Pass errors to Express.
    } else {
      res.send(data)
    }
  })
})
