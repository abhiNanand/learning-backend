HTTP stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol.

Itâ€™s the language that computers use to talk to each other over the web â€” especially between a client (like your browser or app) and a server (like a website or API).
Example:
When you type a URL like https://google.com in your browser:
Your browser sends an HTTP request to Google's servers.
Google's server sends back an HTTP response â€” the HTML, images, etc.
Your browser displays the webpage.

ðŸ”· What is an HTTP client?
An HTTP client is a tool or library that sends HTTP requests and receives HTTP responses.
Examples of HTTP clients:
In the browser: the browser itself is the HTTP client.

In JavaScript (Node.js):

fetch â€” built-in HTTP client in modern JavaScript
axios â€” a popular third-party HTTP client
http â€” built-in Node.js module (older)
undici â€” a modern, fast HTTP client for Node.js

ðŸ”„ Requestâ€“Response Cycle (Simple Illustration)
[You] â†’ Send HTTP request (GET /page) â†’ [Server]
[Server] â†’ Sends back HTTP response (HTML) â†’ [You]
